# Web Scraper Demo Project

Welcome to the **Web Scraper Demo Project**! ðŸš€

This project demonstrates a full-stack web scraping application that allows users to scrape data from websites and visualize the results in a user-friendly interface. It's a combination of a **frontend built with Vite and React** and a **backend built with Flask**, showcasing how to fetch, process, and display data scraped from web pages.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

The Web Scraper Demo Project consists of two main parts:

1. **Frontend**: A sleek, dynamic user interface for interacting with the web scraper. Built with **React** and **Vite**, it provides an intuitive design where users can input URLs to scrape data from and view the results.

2. **Backend**: A powerful API powered by **Flask** that handles the web scraping logic. It processes requests from the frontend, scrapes data from specified websites, and returns the data for display.

## ðŸ”§ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - Vite (for fast development and bundling)
  - CSS (for styling)

- **Backend**:
  - Python
  - Flask (for creating the API)
  - BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

This repository is split into two main directories:

- **front_end**: Contains the React frontend code and the associated README.md.
- **back_end**: Contains the Flask backend code and the associated README.md.

You can find more specific information about each part by checking the corresponding README files in their respective folders:

- **[Frontend README](./front_end/README.md)**: All about the frontend setup, structure, and how to run the frontend locally.
- **[Backend README](./back_end/README.md)**: Information on setting up and running the backend, as well as the web scraping logic.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project running locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web_scraper_demo.git
cd web_scraper_demo
```

### 2. Set up the Backend

- Go to the `back_end` folder and follow the instructions in the **[Backend README](./back_end/README.md)** to set up and run the backend.

### 3. Set up the Frontend

- Go to the `front_end` folder and follow the instructions in the **[Frontend README](./front_end/README.md)** to set up and run the frontend.

### 4. Running the Application

Once both the frontend and backend are set up and running, open the frontend in your browser, and start interacting with the web scraper app!

## ðŸ”§ Local Development

For **local development**, you need to run both the **frontend** and **backend** servers:

- **Backend**: Start the Flask server by following the steps in the backend's README.
- **Frontend**: Start the React development server by following the steps in the frontend's README.
